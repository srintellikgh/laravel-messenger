# Laravel 5 ChatMessenger (+ Pusher)

This package will allow you to add a full user messaging system into your Laravel application. It is a fork of the [cmgmyr/laravel-messenger](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger) with added features such as maximum number of participants in a conversation, and a unique social media sharing code for inviting users to a conversation(otherwise known as Thread in this package).

## Installation (Laravel 4.x)
Installation instructions for Laravel 4 can be [found here](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger/tree/v1).

## Installation (Laravel 5.x)
```
composer require lexxyungcarter/chatmessenger
```

Or place manually in composer.json:

```
"require": {
    "lexxyungcarter/chatmessenger": "^1.0"
}
```

Run:

```
composer update
```

Add the service provider to `config/app.php` under `providers`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider::class,
],
```

> **Note**: If you are using Laravel 5.5, this step is unnecessary. Laravel Messenger supports [Package Discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery).

Publish config:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```
	
Update config file to reference your User Model:

```
config/chatmessenger.php
```

Create a `users` table if you do not have one already. If you need one, the default Laravel migration will be satisfactory.

**(Optional)** Define names of database tables in package config file if you don't want to use default ones:

```php
'messages_table' => 'lexx_messages',
'participants_table' => 'lexx_participants',
'threads_table' => 'lexx_threads',
```
    
Publish migrations:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

Migrate your database:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Add the trait to your user model:

```php
use Lexx\ChatMessenger\Traits\Messagable;

class User extends Authenticatable {
    use Messagable;
}
```

# Pusher Integration
This package utilizes [Pusher Http Laravel](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-laravel) 
that provides pusher services out-of-the-box. All you have to do is require the package, register the service providers, publish the vendor package, and that's it! You're good to go.

Please check out the examples section for a detailed example usage.

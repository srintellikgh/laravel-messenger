## Installation (Laravel 4.x - no longer actively supported)
Installation instructions for Laravel 4 can be [found here](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger/tree/v1).

## Installation (Laravel 5.x)
### Laravel 5.6+
```bash
composer require lexxyungcarter/chatmessenger
```

### Laravel 5.1 > 5.5
```bash
composer require lexxyungcarter/chatmessenger@1.0.8
```

Or place manually in composer.json:

```php
"require": {
    "lexxyungcarter/chatmessenger": "^1.0"
}
```

Run:

```
composer update
```

#### >>> If using Laravel 5.4 and below
> **Note**: Laravel Messenger supports [Package Discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery). If using Laravel 5.5 and above, skip this part.

Add the service provider to `config/app.php` under `providers`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Publish config:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Update config file to reference your User Model:

```php
config/chatmessenger.php
```

Create a `users` table if you do not have one already. If you need one, the default Laravel migration will be satisfactory.

**(Optional)** Define names of database tables in package config file if you don't want to use default ones:

```php
'messages_table' => 'lexx_messages',
'participants_table' => 'lexx_participants',
'threads_table' => 'lexx_threads',
```

Publish migrations:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

Migrate your database:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Add the trait to your user model:

```php
use Lexx\ChatMessenger\Traits\Messagable;

class User extends Authenticatable {
    use Messagable;
}
```

# Pusher Integration
This package utilizes [Pusher Http Laravel](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-laravel)
that provides pusher services out-of-the-box. All you have to do is require the package, register the service providers, publish the vendor package, and that's it! You're good to go.

Please check out the examples section for a detailed example usage.
